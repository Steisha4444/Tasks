        I've been readin' tea leaves at the bottom of the cup
        And now I'm afraid to say that the future isn't lookin' up
        
        I can see the storm clouds
        Startin' to roll in
        The sun is shinin' now, but, it's about to be the end
        We can wait around until the fire burns out
        We can save ourselves (We can save ourselves)
        
        There's greener pastures lying in ahead from me
        There's somethin' better out there and I owe it to myself to see
        And that'll be the way, that you longing to feel thе danger that's been comin' my way
        There's greenеr pastures in ahead, lying in ahead from me
        
        Gotta get out of this war zone, before it's too late
        If the sky is raining ashes, it's time to escape
        We can't wait around until the fire burns out
        We can save ourselves (We can save ourselves)
        
        There's greener pastures lying in ahead from me
        There's somethin' better out there and I owe it to myself to see
        And that'll be the way, that you longing to feel the danger that's been comin' my way
        There's greener pastures lying in ahead, lying in ahead from me
        Lying in ahead from me
        Lying ahead for me
        
        I can see the light in the distant
        I can feel the danger comin' my way
        We can save ourselves (We can save ourselves)
        But we gotta start runnin' now
        I've been readin' tea leaves at the bottom of the cup
        And so I'm afraid to say that the future isn't lookin' up
        I can see the storm clouds
        Startin' to roll in
        The sun is shinin' now, but, it's about to be the end`

        Full of despair, inside a darkness
        Self conscious and scared, held prisoner of war
        Running out of air, buried in a sadness
        Want a way out of this paralyzing world
        And the sound of the cries when a family's loved one dies
        It echoes through a vacant room where a young soul still resides
        
       
        When the night is cold and you feel like no one knows
        What it's like to be the only one buried in this hole
        You can make it to the sunrise (Woh-oh, woh-oh-oh)
        You can make it to the sunrise (Woh-oh, woh-oh-oh)
        
        
        Searching for a way to escape the madness
        A dire need for change as we fight for better days
        The hurt and the pain cut deep like a razor blade
        Holding in a cry for love, abandoned and afraid
 
        When the night is cold and you feel like no one knows
        What it's like to be the only one buried in this hole
        You can make it to the sunrise (Woh-oh, woh-oh-oh)
        You can make it to the sunrise (Woh-oh, woh-oh-oh)
        
       
        I won't go to my grave until a difference is made
        I won't go to my grave until a difference is made
        Until a difference is made

        I had a bad day once again, please, leave me alone

        You're the only reason that I hate everyone
        I'm sick and tired of all the things that keep you away from me
        You go run and tell your friends that I am the enemy
        I hate this house, I hate your mom, and fuck your friends, I hate them all
        You're the only reason that I hate anyone
        I hate anyone, I hate everyone
        You're always talking shit behind my back
        But smile to my face, what's up with that?
        You're the reason that I have to hate everyone
        So good luck on fixing me, and what we could've been
        But you'll always fail to see I'm forever broken
        I hate your guts, I hate his too, I hate myself for loving you
        You're the only reason that I hate anyone
        I hate anyone, I hate everyone
        You're always talking shit behind my back

        You're the reason that I have to hate everyone
        Oh, my dear, I have seen better days
        Because this is the worst day ever
        And I do hate everyone but for you
        You are the only exception
        I hate everyone but you

        I wake up every morning with my head up in a daze
        I'm not sure if I should say this, fuck, I'll say it anyway
        Everybody tries to tell me that I'm going through a phase
        I don't know if it's a phase, I just wanna feel okay, yeah
        I battle with depression, but the question still remains
        Is this post-traumatic stressing or am I suppressing rage?
        And my doctor tries to tell me that I'm going through a phase
        Yeah, it's not a fucking phase, I just wanna feel okay, okay?
        Yeah, I struggle with this bullshit every day
        And it's probably 'cause my demons simultaneously rage
        It obliterates me, disintegrates me, annihilates me
        'Cause I'm about to break down, I'm searching for a way out
        I'm a liar, I'm a cheater, I'm a non-believer
        I'm a popular, popular monster
        I break down, falling into love now with falling apart
        I'm a popular, popular monster
        I think I'm going nowhere like a rat trapped in a maze
        Every wall that I knock down is just a wall that I replace
        I'm in a race against myself, I try to keep a steady pace
        How the fuck will I escape if I never close my case?
        Oh my God, I keep on stressing, every second that I waste
        Is another second sooner to a blessing I won't take
        But my therapist will tell me that I'm going through a stage
        Yeah, it's not a fucking stage, I just wanna feel okay, okay
        Motherfucker, now you got my attention
        I need to change a couple things 'cause something is missing
        And what if I were to lie? Tell you everything is fine
        Every single fucking day I get closer to the grave, I am terrified
        I fell asleep at the wheel again
        Crashed my car just to feel again
        It obliterates me, disintegrates me, annihilates me
        'Cause I'm about to break down, I'm searching for a way out
        I'm a liar, I'm a cheater, I'm a non-believer
        I'm a popular, popular monster
        I break down, falling into love now with falling apart
        I'm a popular, popular fucking monster
        Yeah, here we go again, motherfucker, oh
        We're sick and tired of wondering
        Praying to a god that you don't believe
        We're searching for the truth in the lost and found
        So the question I ask is
        Oh, where the fuck is your god now?

        I'm a liar, I'm a cheater, I'm a non-believer
        I'm a popular, popular monster
        I break down, falling into love now with falling apart
